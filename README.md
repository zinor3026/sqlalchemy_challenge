## Description:
Background: You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.
For this project, The jupyter notebook and flask are in SurfsUp folder along with resources.
 ## Installations
 I used pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy,flask and datetime to finish the analysis.
 ## Other Instructions:

 ## Contributing
 Almost all problems are solved with the help of the activities and the codes used during the class.
 To show only some tickers on bar chart, it was formatted with the help of ChatGPT. 
 The final section of getting start time and end time and calculating minimum, maximum and average is also solved witht the help of ChatGPT. The datetime.strptime used to convert strings to datetime object was a new function that I learnt through this project.
